# WindowsEnum
Basic Windows machine enumeration PowerShell script I've created to collect information on targets. 



<H2> Description</H2>

Running the script will give some basic Windows device enumeration including:

* Network settings
* Computer Information
* An attempt to pull any unquoted service paths for Program Files
* Determination for domain accounts.
* Local enumeration if device is not joined to domain.


This script will be developed over time!
